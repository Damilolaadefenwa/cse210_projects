WEEK 03: ENCAPSULATION (assignment)
MAIN program class: This will contain the instances of the classes and the program menu(handling user interation).
CLASSES
    CLASS 1: Scripture.cs // This class should keep track of both the reference and text(from word.cs) of the Scripture.
                       // It should be able to hides randomly select words and get the display text from words.cs as a string,
                       // It should be able to check if the scripture is completely hidden so to know when to stop the program. 
    Attributes:( member Variables)
        _reference -: // type: Reference   
        _entries -: // type: List<Word>    
    Behaviors:(Methods)
        HideRandomWords (numberToHide : int ) //type:void : This will determine number of words to hide when the user press enter key.
        GetDisplayText()  //type:string : This will call the display-text in the words.cs to show hidden text with underscore or show it.
        IsCompletelyHidden() //type:bool : This will check to know when to quit the program.
        

    CLASS 2: Reference.cs // This class will keep / hold tracks of randomly selects scripture book, chapter and the verse information.
                        //It should have the ability to get the display text of the reference, which is just a string combining the book, chapter, and verse (or verses). 
                       //It is better to use a constructor for each data elements that this class stores,than having getters and setters.
    Attributes:(member Variables)
        _book : // type: string  
        _chapter : // type: int  
        _verse : // type: int
        _endVerse : // type: int
    Behaviors:(Methods)
        GetDisplayText() //type:void
        //possible getters and setters. will be replace with a constructor.


    CLASS 3: Words.cs // This class will hold or keeps track of single words(in the scripture-book) and determine
                      // whether it should be shown or hidden(with underscores).
                      // The key behaviors for the Word class are to hide and show(display text of that Word) a word and to check if a word is hidden or not.
    Attributes:(Variables)
        _text : // type:string
        _isHidden : // type: bool
    Behaviors:(Methods)
        Hide() : //type: void : This will hides with underscore
        Show() : //type: void : This will show words
        IsHidden() : //type: bool: 
        GetDisplayText(): //type: string
